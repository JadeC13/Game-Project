# Apocalypse Fashionista
![Project Logo](assets/button.png)

Welcome to my first ever browser game that I made for my NC State coding bootcamp project.

# About my game
In my game, you get to dress up Jade while she's in a zombie apocalypse. Unlike other survivalists though, Jade prioritizes style over functionality. 

So don't expect to see her wearing heavy military gear! Unless its bedazzled of course ;3

# Features

- **Sound Effects!**: Click on any of Jades clothing items or hairs to hear a cute shimmer!
- **Express Yourself!**: Pick from a variety of clothing options to create an apocalypse look that is totally you!
- **Game Over!**: Once you're done dressing Jade up, you get a funny little game over message that gives you insight into her possible future.

# Controls
Upon starting up my game, you will be greeted with a blank slate version of Jade for you to customize her.

To start dressing her up, click on one of the three headers to the right of her in the green transparent box.

Once you click on one of them (you may need to double click them), you will be shown three different articles of clothing or hair for you to pick from. 

Once you have chosen an article of clothing, if you change your mind and want to switch your top, just click on the item that is on Jade so it can be removed and placed back into the top section. For example, If I pick her cheetah print top and decide I want to put her in her zip up instead, I would click on the cheetah print top that is on her, watch it move back to the top section, and click on the zip up instead.

When you are all done dressing Jade up, just click done! And you will be greeted with the game over screen. Wanna play again? Just press the back button!

If you ever forget how to play, theres a little info box thats next to the main screen with the instructions!
