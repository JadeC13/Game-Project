# Game-Project
Welcome to my first ever browser game that I made for my NC State coding bootcamp project. The official title is tbd.


# About my game
In my game, you get to dress up Jade while she's in a zombie apocalypse. Unlike other survivalists though, Jade prioritizes style over functionality. 

So don't expect to see her wearing heavy military gear! Unless its bedazzled of course ;3 

# Controls
To play my game all you need to do is select the clothing option you would like to view, for example 'tops', and click on the image or clothing item to add onto her body. If you'd like to remove an item, just click the item that is on her body and poof, it's gone!

I plan on updating this game in the future. So look forward to more clothes, some weapons, and hopefully a more dynamic ending screen that will change depending on what clothes you picked :D

# Credits
The base body I used for Jade was drawn and colored by me on pixlr.com

The hair, tops, and bottoms were also drawn by me using pixlr.com. Same with the heart button :D
